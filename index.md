## Short bio

I graduated in **2019** from the [École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.fr) and got a Master Degree from the [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en/) in mathematics and machine learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

**Since September 2019** I am a PhD Student in Statistics under a [CIFRE](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid22130/les-cifre.html/) contract. I am jointly working at the [LPSM, Sorbonne Université](https://www.lpsm.paris/) under the supervision of [Olivier Wintenberger](http://wintenberger.fr/) and at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/groupe-edf/inventer-l-avenir-de-l-energie/r-d-un-savoir-faire-mondial) under the supervision of [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) and Thi Thu Huong Hoang.


## PhD Outline

My PhD considers adaptive methods for time series forecasting, mainly focusing on state-space representations. The industrial application at EDF is electricity load forecasting.

#### Analysis of the Extended Kalman Filter in the degenerate static setting 
The objective was to enrich the link between Kalman Filters and the optimization community. It led to the following preprints:
* de Vilmarest, J. and Wintenberger, O. (2020). [Stochastic online optimization using kalman recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03636).
* de Vilmarest, J. and Wintenberger, O. (2019). [Logarithmic Regret for parameter-free Online Logistic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09803).

#### VIKING: Variational Bayesian Variance Tracking
As there is no consensus to choose the hyper-parameters of Kalman Filters we are working on state-space models with unknown variances, which are represented as additional latent variables. This led to the following preprint:
* de Vilmarest, J. and Wintenberger, O. (2021). [Recursive Estimation of State-Space Noise Covariance Matrix by Approximate Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10777).

#### Electricity Load Forecasting
We considered EDF data and also public datasets. First we studied the French electricity load provided by [RTE](https://www.rte-france.com/), the French grid operator, yielding the following publication:
* Obst, D., de Vilmarest, J. and Goude, Y. (2021). [Adaptive Methods for Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting During COVID-19 Lockdown in France](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9382417?casa_token=pIp_LDE7e0MAAAAA:F3lsUFypBN28V95VtTBd2NQyf7vr2hDmh77GlR4fkvmyvAprzuh5VqDV-nBS9jqIDVWHbxv2ecI6). *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*.

Second, we participated in electricity load forecasting competitions to assert the performance of our methods:
* We obtained with Y. Goude the first place in the competition [Day-Ahead Electricity Demand Forecasting: Post-COVID Paradigm](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/day-ahead-electricity-demand-forecasting-post-covid-paradigm).
* I participated in [Competition on building energy consumption forecasting](http://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/smartgridcompetitions/). Results to be announced.
